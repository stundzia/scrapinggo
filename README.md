# Scraping with Go

Just a bunch of examples for various web scraping scenarios with Go(Lang). Most of these were
used for the Go Dev Meetup 2023 https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-lnxlhzys/events/293298314/?isFirstPublish=true.
The code is a mess at the moment, but hopefully I'll find time to clean it up eventually.
